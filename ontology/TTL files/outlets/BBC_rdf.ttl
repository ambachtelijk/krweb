################ Ontology Development ####################################

# The following turtle statments instanciate our Ontology, it consits of three main parts
# 1. Instanciating the subclass relations between classes
# 2. Instanciating the actions participants took
# 3. Instanciating the other relations in the ontology
# We instanciate the calsses through the predicate instanciation

#### Instanciating classes and suclass relations ####

An immediate recess of the Senate is called. A minute later, Officer Eugene Goodman runs to respond to the initial breach. He warns Senator Mitt Romney that the mob is approaching. Mr Romney turns and runs through a capitol hallway to safety. The mob, a floor below them, has already begun to search for the Senate chamber. Officer Goodman makes his way down to the first floor where he encounters the mob. He lures the armed rioters away from the upper chamber. Many of these individuals have been calling for Mr Pence to be hanged. By that point, the rioters are 'within 100ft' (30m) of Mr Pence and a foot away from one of the doors to the chamber. Many senators are still inside. At the same time, Ms Pelosi is rushed from the house floor. She is evacuated entirely from the Capitol complex to a secure off-site location. Her staff barricade themselves into a conference room, hiding under a table. Staff members of the House leader speak softly, frantically, to each other. Just outside, rioters are spreading out across the building, searching for Ms Pelosi herself. The rioters chant: 'Where are you Nancy?' In an audio clip, we hear one staff member whisper: 'They're pounding on doors trying to find her.' One man breaks open the outer door to the office where the staff are hiding, but not the inner door. Another tries as well, but eventually moves on.".
