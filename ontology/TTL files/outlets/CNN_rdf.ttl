################ Ontology Development ####################################

# The following turtle Statements instanciate our Ontology, it consits of three main parts
# 1. Instanciating the subclass relations between classes
# 2. Instanciating the actions participants took
# 3. Instanciating the other relations in the ontology
# We instanciate the classes through the predicate instanciation

#### Instanciating classes and suclass relations ####
