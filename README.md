# Detecting narrative perspectives
The goal of this research project is to extract multiple narrations of news events from existing KGs such as DBpedia, Wikidata, EventKG by using a formal structure presented in a paper. The project proposes to build an ontology based on this formalization, identify sets of facts in the KGs to instantiate the ontology, and use SPARQL to visualize and explore the data. The research methodology involves identifying similar narratives that represent the same event from different perspectives using a rule-based approach or clustering methods such as KG embeddings. A minimal evaluation for the approach is also proposed. Resources such as Google Drive, Notion, WebVOWL, and Overleaf are provided to support the project.
