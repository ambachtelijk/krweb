Speaking to Newsnight's US correspondent David Grossman, one member of the group says: ' We're taking our country back.' One of the group has a radio. 'It was clear he was communicating - getting messages, sending messages to somebody,' our correspondent said."

'I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,' he said."

They begin marching towards the police barrier and get past officers. The police, outnumbered, try to contain them. Trump supporters wield flags and weapons. One man stands on a makeshift gallows, complete with a noose. The crowd chants: 'Fight for Trump' Minutes later, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi commences the certification process. "

'Multiple law-enforcement injuries,' he adds in a panicked voice. Capitol police send an evacuation warning."

They push inside, hopping through the broken glass. They then kick open the doors to let others in. Some wear hoods and helmets, some hold cameras or Confederate flags. An immediate recess of the Senate is called. A minute later, Officer Eugene Goodman runs to respond to the initial breach. He warns Senator Mitt Romney that the mob is approaching. Mr Romney turns and runs through a capitol hallway to safety. The mob, a floor below them, has already begun to search for the Senate chamber. Officer Goodman makes his way down to the first floor where he encounters the mob. He lures the armed rioters away from the upper chamber. Many of these individuals have been calling for Mr Pence to be hanged. By that point, the rioters are 'within 100ft' (30m) of Mr Pence and a foot away from one of the doors to the chamber. Many senators are still inside. At the same time, Ms Pelosi is rushed from the house floor. She is evacuated entirely from the Capitol complex to a secure off-site location. Her staff barricade themselves into a conference room, hiding under a table. Staff members of the House leader speak softly, frantically, to each other. Just outside, rioters are spreading out across the building, searching for Ms Pelosi herself. The rioters chant: 'Where are you Nancy?' In an audio clip, we hear one staff member whisper: 'They're pounding on doors trying to find her.' One man breaks open the outer door to the office where the staff are hiding, but not the inner door. Another tries as well, but eventually moves on."

Others break in from outside through various doors around the building. They open the east side door of the rotunda to let more people in, flooding through the doors and overwhelming the officers. The House floor debate is suspended to update members. House members are told to reach for tear gas masks and be prepared to use them. The House is called back into session in the hope of continuing the count. But minutes later the House is abruptly recessed. Members are told to get down under their chairs if necessary. 'Folks have entered the rotunda and are coming this way,' lawmakers are told. Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell sends a text to his wife: 'I love you and the babies. Please hug them for me'.The mob outside the chamber grows larger and they get within feet of the house door."
http://example.com/E_BBC_9,2021-01-06T14:26:00,,"President Trump called Senator Mike Lee, according to the Utah Republican who has provided the trial lawyers with a copy of a log from his mobile phone. According to his office, he received a call from the White House switchboard number - and the call lasted four minutes. Mr Lee has said that apparently the call was meant for Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville, and that he handed his phone to his colleague. Mr Tuberville told reporters that he informed Mr Trump that Mr Pence had been evacuated from the Senate floor. 'I said: Mr President, they've taken the vice-president out. They want me to get off the phone, I gotta go.' House impeachment managers say it is further evidence that the president knew how much danger his vice-president was in."

In a hallway outside the House chamber, a group attempts to force its way through a set of locked doors. The glass window panes on the doors are shattered. A rioter uses a baton to smash through as the crowd around him chants 'break it down, break it down' Footage shows the hands of an officer on the other side, holding a gun and pointing it toward the mob. We hear a shot and see Babbitt fall to the ground. People still inside the gallery of the chamber are trapped. They tell each other to take off their congressional pins. In the meantime, a number of rioters reach the inside of the Senate gallery. 'Is this the Senate?' one demands to know. 'Where are they?' another asks, apparently referring to the evacuated senators. Video footage shows some rioters rifling through papers and materials left behind by lawmakers. 'There's got to be something we can use against these scumbags,' one says"
